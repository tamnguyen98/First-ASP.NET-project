# CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) Demo with ASP.NET

This is a little demo I made as I was learning ASP.NET that focus on modifying the Database with CRUD.
This repo contains three project types: Razor pages, MVC, and API. All of them essentially do the same thing,
while MVC and Razor demo has a interactable UI (that looks the same).

The UI of the MVC and Razor pages can be seen below with the GIF
